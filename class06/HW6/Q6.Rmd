Write your own function starting from the code above that analyzes protein drug interactions by reading in any protein PDB data and outputs a plot for the specified protein.

```{r}
# library bio3d package to use its functions
library(bio3d)

# Function to analyze a protein with given PDB id, by plotting the Bfactor against residue number, as well as highlighting the secondary structure of chainA.
# input = protein PDB id
# output = plot of B factor against residue number.
# usage: analyzeP("PDB id of the target protein")
analyzeP <- function(id){
  s <- read.pdb(id)
  s.chainA <- trim.pdb(s, chain="A", elety="CA")
  s.b <- s.chainA$atom$b
  plotb3(s.b, sse=s.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
}

# example
analyzeP("4AKE") # kinase with drug
analyzeP("1AKE") # kinase no drug
analyzeP("1E4Y") # kinase with drug

```
